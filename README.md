# Weather-app

Project Description:
Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. The purpose of developing weather app is to fetch the data in the need of taking information about weather worldwide. Another purpose for developing this software is to generate the report automatically at the end of the session or in the between of the session. My AIM is to design and implement the frontend and backend for monitoring the Weather for all location using HTML, CSS, JS, Node & Express. 


Approach: 
	I started building my code in VISUAL STUDIO CODE. I referred previous lessons to get more clarity over my project. In this project, I will be building a weather application. This application will show the temperature of a location. To fetch weather information, we will need an API. The API will send us a JSON from which we will extract the required data that is the temperature and city of the location. I used https://openweathermap.org/ for getting weather for the particular city in my backend. Frontend was build using HTML, CSS. I built this project on my own without getting help from the external sources.


Tech-Stack Used:
		The Tech I have used to implement the projects are HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, NODE JS, EXPRESS.
•	HTML: Made the structure and designed the body of the website by identifying the appropriate elements required.
•	CSS: Used to describe the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts and made to adapt the presentation to different types of devices.
•	JAVASCRIPT: Used to make web pages interactive.
•	Node Js: Used for traditional web sites and back-end API services.
•	Express Framework: To provide server-side logic for web and mobile applications.
